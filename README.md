# ROR Roadmap
This is the public hub where you can find information about what is happening at ROR and contribute feedback about what ROR should do in the future. There are three key sections of this repository:
1. Public roadmap board
2. Inbox board
3. Community discussion forum


### Public roadmap board
:spiral_calendar: _High-level summary of current, planned, and completed activities_

The [public roadmap board](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/projects/3) offers an at-a-glance view of what ROR is working on or exploring for the future. This includes development work as well as other activities, such as sustainability planning and community engagement. 

### Inbox board
:file_cabinet: _A central store of all proposed development work_

The [inbox board](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/projects/1) is used for storing and scoping proposed development work. Issues on this board move through ROR's development workflow as they are reviewed, prioritized, and undergo specification, and as ROR solicits community feedback. When issues are ready to be worked on, they are moved to the [software development board](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/3). 

### Community discussion forum
:speech_balloon: _A forum for suggesting improvements and asking questions_

The [community discussion forum](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/discussions) is a space for users to submit feedback and ask (or answer) questions about ROR. Some of these discussion topics will turn into issues tracked on the development boards. 

# How to contribute
If you have feedback to contribute, please start a discussion topic in the [community discussion forum](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/discussions). You can also open an issue in a service-specific repository or in this repository, but we prefer that you start in the discussion forum. Please do not submit pull requests at this time. 

If you have feedback about the contents of the registry, e.g., if you wish to suggest any new organizations to be added or any changes to an existing record, use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJYaMTCwS7muuTa-B_CnAtCSkKzt19lkirAKG4u7umH9Nosg/viewform).
