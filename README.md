# ROR Roadmap
This is the public hub where you can find information about what is happening at ROR and contribute feedback about what ROR should do in the future. To make sure your feedback is considered, please contribute via the [channels described below](#how-to-contribute).

# How to follow the roadmap and development process
Information about the ROR roadmap and development work (active, planned, or completed) is tracked on the following boards:

- [Public roadmap board](#public-roadmap-board)
- [Inbox board](#inbox-board)
- [Product development board](#product-development-board)
- [Software development board](#software-development-board)

## Public roadmap board
:spiral_calendar: _High-level summary of current, planned, and completed activities_

The [public roadmap board](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/projects/3) offers an at-a-glance view of what ROR is working on or exploring for the future. This includes development work as well as other activities, such as sustainability planning and community engagement. 

## Inbox board
:file_cabinet: _A central store of all proposed development work_

The [inbox board](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/11) is used for storing and scoping proposed development work. 

## Product development board
:bulb: _Where proposed development work goes through a product review and development workflow_

Issues from the [inbox board](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/11) move through ROR's [product development workflow](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/10) as they are reviewed, prioritized, and undergo specification, and as ROR solicits community feedback. 

## Software development board
:hammer_and_wrench: _Work that is under active development_

When issues from the [product development board](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/10) are ready to be worked on, they are moved to the [software development board](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/3). 


# How to contribute

## Feature requests
If you have suggestions for new ROR features or improvements to existing features, please open an issue in this repository using the [Feature request template](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D). If you don't have all the information needed to complete the issue template, get in touch with us via support@ror.org or post your questions in the [ROR Community Forum](https://groups.google.com/a/ror.org/g/ror-community). Please do not submit pull requests at this time. 

## Bug reports
If you find a problem with the [ROR API](https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api), [website](https://ror.org/) or [search interface](https://ror.org/search), please open an issue using the [Bug report template](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+). 

*Note: Please do not open a bug report to request changes to ROR record data, such as adding new ROR records or changing data on existing records! ROR record data changes are managed through a community-based curation process. To request changes to ROR record data, see [Curation requests](#curation-requests) below.*

## Schema change requests
If you have suggestions for changes to the ROR data model, we recommend that you review the [current schema](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-schema/tree/master) and [data model documentation](https://ror.readme.io/docs/ror-data-structure) before requesting a change.

You can submit a schema change request in this repository using the [Schema change request issue template](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D). If you don't have all the information needed to complete the issue template, please start in the [ROR Community Forum](https://groups.google.com/a/ror.org/g/ror-community). Please do not submit pull requests at this time. 

Schema change requests will be considered as part of the [schema & API versioning process](https://ror.readme.io/docs/schema-versions), which includes a community comment period.

## Curation requests
If you have feedback about the contents of the registry, e.g., if you wish to suggest any new organizations to be added or any changes to an existing record, use [this form](https://curation-request.ror.org). Read more about the registry's [curation model](https://ror.org/registry) and follow the workflow in the [ror-updates Github repository](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates). 

## Code contributions
If you've written code that works with the [ROR API](https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api) or [data dump](https://ror.readme.io/docs/data-dump) that you'd like to share, please make a pull request in [ror-utilities](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-utilities) or add the topic [research-organization-registry](https://github.com/topics/research-organization-registry) to your own repository.

If you're interested in making code contributions to ROR tools and services, like [ror-api](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-api) and [ror-app](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-app), please contact us at info@ror.org . We are not likely to accept community pull requests unrelated to tasks on our [software development board](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/3).
