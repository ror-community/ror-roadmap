# ROR Roadmap
This is the public hub where you can find information about what is happening at ROR and contribute feedback about what ROR should do in the future. There are three key sections of this repository:
1. [Public roadmap board](#public-roadmap-board)
2. [Inbox board](#inbox-board)
3. [Community discussion forum](#community-discussion-forum)


### Public roadmap board
:spiral_calendar: _High-level summary of current, planned, and completed activities_

The [public roadmap board](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/projects/3) offers an at-a-glance view of what ROR is working on or exploring for the future. This includes development work as well as other activities, such as sustainability planning and community engagement. 

### Inbox board
:file_cabinet: _A central store of all proposed development work_

The [inbox board](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/projects/1) is used for storing and scoping proposed development work. Issues on this board move through ROR's development workflow as they are reviewed, prioritized, and undergo specification, and as ROR solicits community feedback. When issues are ready to be worked on, they are moved to the [software development board](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/3). 

### Community discussion forum
:speech_balloon: _A forum for suggesting improvements and asking questions_

The [community discussion forum](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/discussions) is a space for users to submit feedback and ask (or answer) questions about ROR. Some of these discussion topics will turn into issues tracked on the development boards. 

# How to contribute

### Feature requests
If you have suggestions for new ROR features or improvements to existing features, please start a discussion topic in the [community discussion forum](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/discussions). You can also open an issue in this repository using the [Feature request template](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D). If you don't have all  the  information needed to complete the issue template, please start in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/discussions). Please do not submit pull requests at this time. 

### Bug reports
If you find a problem with the ROR API, website or search interface, please open an issue using the [Bug report template](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+). 

*Note: Please do not open a bug report to request changes to ROR record data, such as adding new ROR records or changing data on existing records! ROR record data changes are managed through a Community Curation Process. To request changes to ROR record data, see [Curation requests](#curation-requests) below.*

### Curation requests
If you have feedback about the contents of the registry, e.g., if you wish to suggest any new organizations to be added or any changes to an existing record, use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJYaMTCwS7muuTa-B_CnAtCSkKzt19lkirAKG4u7umH9Nosg/viewform). You can read more about the registry's curation workflow [here](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates). 

### Code contributions
If you've written code that works with the ROR API or data dump that you'd like to share, please make a pull request in [ror-utilities](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-utilities) or add the topic [research-organization-registry](https://github.com/topics/research-organization-registry) to your own repository.

If you're interested in making code contributions to ROR tools and services, like [ror-api](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-api) and [ror-app](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-app), please contact us at info@ror.org . We are not likely to accept community pull requests unrelated to tasks on our [software development board](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/3).
